First meeting was at an after party for an educational tech event for women. As a husband of one of the attendees, he seemed like a rad, supportive tech guy. Good convos. I looked forward to seeing him around town again.

Second meeting was another after party for a large tech conference in town. I said hello. Quickly he slid into a long conversation where he talked about his admiration for various tech gods because they "print money." He used that term at least 5 times in the conversation. I was unimpressed.

Third meeting was also at an after party (or two...). The volume levels of his conversation dominated the table while he explained what's what about something I don't remember being important. After I escaped to another party and was having a reasonable conversation with a prominent tech person, he sauntered up and hijacked the conversation to tell the guy what's wrong with everything the tech guy does. I prompty turned around and started looking for my friends. As soon as I found them I quickly interrupted the dude's berating so I could say goodbye to the tech guy. In that moment, that sweet, sweet moment, the drunk hijacker dumped his drink straigt down his shirt. I smirked with a feeling of justice: Karma 'ill getcha.
