title: Technical Metaphors
---

Dude at work is explaining some technical detail or maneavour to a coworker. He says, "...this part is like a girl with booby face."

There is a long pause while the coworker is silent.

Dude then explains it, sorta. "It's like when all you can see on a girl is her big boobs..."

Oh. Right. That makes total sense. Idiots.
