If attracting a lady with exactly the same interests is important to you be sure to include all of the obscure references to the culture you want emulated. 

Examples:

* showing off your binary arm cuff tattoo and labeling it "Nerd Cred"
* listing the most obscure beer you've ever had and drop insider jokes about it
* talk about _fill in interest of choice_ in every paragraph (in Portland this is most often bike related)
* tell us your perfect night is playing reddit board games (do I want to know what that is?)
