The first message was nice enough but his profile had indicated some basic dealbreaker habits. My reply was straight-foward, direct and wished him well on his quest for love.

*Pro-tip:* While honest, touting your mental health problems and how much you <3 cigarettes is not the best way to sell yourself. Think, first impressions.

Within a week another message from the same guy appeared in my inbox. Again, my reply gently turned him down.

Third message was practically begging to meetup. Coxing me with drink and food, I agreed to meet. I was curious why he was so dead set on meeting.

I got to the restaurant early, ordered a whiskey and waited. When he wandered up to the table I'm pretty sure my jaw dropped a little. Decked out in his best sweatpants and slippers, he looked like he had just gotten out of bed.

I ordered a steak to go with my whiskey. I deserved it.

We chatted awhile about his struggle with his bipolar disorder, drug addiction and blossuming recording studio.

Still unable to see how we had anything in common, I finally asked, "So why were you so dead set on meeting me?"

"I really like your glasses. I once loved a girl that had great glasses."

If only it were that simple.

The next day I googled him and found a video of him dancing to house music while "robotripping":http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=robotripping.
