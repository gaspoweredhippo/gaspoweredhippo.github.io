title: A Romantic Evening
---

I went over to my date's house for a summer BBQ with him and his housemate. Dinner went well. Good food. Tasty wine. Lots of laughter. After dinner my date and I ventured into his backyard to lounge on a blanket and enjoy each other's company. Leaned up against a rock that resembled a chair on a perfect summer evening next to a wonderful man, I was content. As we chatted I felt a furry creature walk up next to me and looked over to find one of his cats. In the split second I spent staring at the cat, trying to remember its name, horror struck. The cat peed on me. That's right, peed. Everyone, except the cat, was moritfied.
